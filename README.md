# SwapF  Quest 

## SwapF Quest is an Automated Market Maker(AMMs) research that I Cipheriousxyz started in an attempt to study,improve  my understanding and also innovate in the field of AMMs.
The skills or technical requirements for understanding this project is;
 - Solidity;a domain specific programming language for the Ethereum Smart Contract Development.
 - Knowledge of Decentralized-Finance(DeFi).
 - Blockchain; a public transaction journal of who owns what and who transacts what.
 - Foundry; a framework for writing and testing smart contracts in solidity.
 - Testing strategies;uint testing, fuzz testing, Formal verification, Fork testing etc
 - Maximal Extractable Value(MEV);The act of extracting more value from transaction inclusion on blockchains aside block building rewards.
 - Game Theory.

## Engineering Approach
This is the exact approach thaty i follow orchestrating and implementing ideas, reproducing great protocols and innovating things in my quest to be a great engineer.
It is an algorithm propose by the Elon Musk;
